# Contact List CRUD App Features

- **Create (C):**
  - Add new contacts to the list.

- **Read (R):**
  - View all contacts.
  - Search contacts via scroll.

- **Update (U):**
  - Edit contact details.

- **Delete (D):**
  - Remove unwanted contacts.

The application will allow users to keep record of all their contact's information as well as edit thier list when necessary. <br><br>
**Application highlights:** the ability to add, view, edit, and delete contact's information until a updated version is created 
that will add more features. <br><br>

I chose to build my app using the CRUD approach because I knew it would be a challenge for me, a beginner, to find out exactly how to get
the application running the way I wanted. Having to create buttons to allow users to be able to add, edit, and delete the list was challenging
because I was having issues on getting them to function correctly. Some buttons, when clicked would do nothing. Others when clicked, did not do
what I wanted them to do. I had to research my issues to figure out what I was missing or doing wrong. Using the resources that are available 
helps alot. Once I found the solutions to my problems, I was able to correct them and get the functionality of the buttons to work properly.

## Usage

Your Contact List App is ready to use once it's open in your web browser. Here's how you can interact with it:

1. **Adding a Contact**:
- Fill out the contact information in the input fields provided in the form.
- Enter the contact's first name, last name, phone number, and email.
- Click the "Add Contact" button. The contact will be added to the list below the form.

2. **Viewing Contacts**:
- All added contacts are displayed in the table under the "First Name," "Last Name," "Phone Number," "Email," and "Action" columns.

3. **Updating a Contact**:
- To update a contact, click the "Update" button next to the contact you want to edit.
- A prompt will appear, allowing you to modify the contact's details (first name, last name, phone number, and email).
- After making changes, click "OK" in the prompt to save the updates.

4. **Deleting a Contact**:
- To delete a contact, click the "Delete" button next to the contact you wish to remove.
- A confirmation dialog will appear, asking if you are sure you want to delete the contact. Click "OK" to confirm and delete.

5. **Styling and Layout**:
- The project uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a clean and responsive design. You can customize the styling further by editing your custom CSS file, "stylesheet.css."

The Contact List App is designed for managing a list of contacts. It allows you to add, view, update, and delete contact entries interactively in the web browser.

For any additional features or more advanced usage, you may need to refer to your JavaScript code in the "index.js" file. If you've implemented server communication for data storage and retrieval, ensure that your server is up and running as expected.

These instructions should help you install and use the Contact List App effectively.
