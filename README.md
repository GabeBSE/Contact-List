# Contact List CRUD App Features

- **Create (C):**
  - Add new contacts to the list.

- **Read (R):**
  - View all contacts.
  - Search contacts via scroll.

- **Update (U):**
  - Edit contact details.

- **Delete (D):**
  - Remove unwanted contacts.

The application will allow users to keep record of all their contact's information as well as edit thier list when necessary. <br><br>
**Application highlights:** the ability to add, view, edit, and delete contact's information until a updated version is created 
that will add more features. <br><br>

I chose to build my app using the CRUD approach because I knew it would be a challenge for me, a beginner, to find out exactly how to get
the application running the way I wanted. Having to create buttons to allow users to be able to add, edit, and delete the list was challenging
because I was having issues on getting them to function correctly. Some buttons, when clicked would do nothing. Others when clicked, did not do
what I wanted them to do. I had to research my issues to figure out what I was missing or doing wrong. Using the resources that are available 
helps alot. Once I found the solutions to my problems, I was able to correct them and get the functionality of the buttons to work properly.
